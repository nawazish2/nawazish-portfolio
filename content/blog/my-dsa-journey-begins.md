# My DSA Journey Begins

Hello everyone! 👋

I'm Nawazish Khan, a 3rd-year Computer Science student, and I've officially started my journey into the world of **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**. In this post, I want to share my experience, the resources I'm using, and my roadmap for the coming months.

## Why DSA?

As a CS student aspiring to become a software engineer, I realized that DSA is the foundation of problem-solving in programming. Whether it's cracking coding interviews or building efficient applications, a strong understanding of DSA is essential.

## My Learning Resources

Here are the main resources I'm using:

1. **TakeUForward (Striver's A2Z DSA Sheet)** - A comprehensive roadmap covering all topics
2. **LeetCode** - For practice and tracking progress
3. **C++ Documentation** - Since I'm implementing everything in C++

## Current Progress

I've started with the basics:

- Arrays and their operations
- Time and Space Complexity analysis
- Basic sorting algorithms

```cpp
// My first implementation of Bubble Sort
void bubbleSort(vector<int>& arr) {
    int n = arr.size();
    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n - i - 1; j++) {
            if (arr[j] > arr[j + 1]) {
                swap(arr[j], arr[j + 1]);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## My Goals

By the end of 2025, I want to:

- Complete the A2Z DSA sheet
- Solve 300+ problems on LeetCode
- Feel confident in coding interviews

## Stay Connected

I'll be sharing my progress here on my blog. Follow me on [Twitter](https://x.com/nawazish_khan44) for daily updates!
